Webpack Setup for Basic Project This folder contains a basic setup for a webpack project. The setup includes configuration files, loaders, and plugins to get started with a simple project.

Table of Contents Setup Entry Points, Output, and Loaders Plugins Code Splitting Development Server Setup To use this project setup, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine. Install the dependencies by running npm install. Run the development server using npm start. Entry Points, Output, and Loaders Webpack uses entry points to determine which files should be bundled together. In this setup, the entry point is src/index.js.

The output of the webpack build is configured to be saved in the dist folder. The main output file is bundle.js.

Loaders are used to preprocess files before they are added to the bundle. In this setup, we have included the following loaders:

babel-loader: transpiles ES6+ code to ES5 syntax. style-loader and css-loader: handle importing CSS files into the bundle. Plugins Plugins are used to extend the functionality of webpack. In this setup, we have included the following plugins:

html-webpack-plugin: generates an HTML file with the bundle.js script tag included. clean-webpack-plugin: cleans the dist folder before each build. Code Splitting Code splitting is a technique used to split the code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on-demand. This can help to reduce the initial load time of the application.

In this setup, we have included the SplitChunksPlugin to split the code into chunks. The configuration is set up to create a separate chunk for vendor code (such as libraries) and to split code based on the maximum size of the chunk.

Development Server The webpack development server is a tool that allows you to serve your project locally and see changes in real-time. In this setup, we have included the webpack-dev-server package, which can be started using npm start.

The server is configured to serve files from the dist folder, and to automatically reload the page when changes are made to the code. The server can be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
